Source code for the 2014 Android Game by Odintsofftware

This game was made with an old version of libGDX using Eclipse. It make use of the Google Play Services lib (project inlcuded). 
The code is provided "as is" for anyone interested under MIT License. There are no good practices being used in this game, since it's a simple one and all code is basically residing in GameScreen.java.


It's an old game now and never had any success. So probably best to share the source. (I still plan to make RSR2!)

Thanks!
